                        When Martin Van Buren became President in 1837, the US had no debt.  That's because his predecessor, Andrew Jackson, inherited a bill of $58 million, declared it a "national curse", and paid it off.  But, hey, stuff happens, and Van Buren found himself looking at the need to do something about the Panic of 1837.  So he started borrowing.  And we haven't been debt free since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also haven't been free from finger pointing over who's responsible.  Because to say we're not debt-free is, ahem, something of an understatement. Our debt has increased (ballooned? exploded? metastacized?) from the $1.5 million Van Burren borrrowed to over $30 trillion today.  It's become a familiar game: Republicans blame "tax and spend" Democratics for running up deficits, while Democrats look at Republicans' spending history and call them hypocrites.

                        The truth is that both sides, to a pretty remarkable degree, are equally responsible for the current state of the debt.  That's because no matter who's in charge, events of the day drive the need, or at least the urge, to spend.  Let's take a look.

                                Don't be fooled by what look like small numbers during the 70s.  Nixon increased the debt by 34%, while the four presidents who preceded him increased it by an average of only 8% each.

                                The Reagan - Bush era was the beginning of the modern spike in debt, as annual budget deficits increased considerably.  Reagan came into office promising smaller government in the form of both reduced taxes and reduced spending.  Reducing taxes turned out to be a lot easier than taking away government benefits.  So taxes went down, but expenditures didn't.  As anyone who balances a checkbook at their kitchen table can tell you, making less and spending more is not the path to paying down debt.  The national debt increased at an unprecedented rate.

                                The bars associated with the Clinton years stand out by staying down.  Fiscally, Clinton was Reagan's opposite: Clinton raised taxes, particularly on the wealthy, and cut spending.  It also didn't hurt that he presided over a period of great economic growth (including the dot-com boom).  The result was balanced budgets -- we haven't seen them since.

                                Obama took office during the beginning stages of the Great Recession, which had started under Bush II when the housing bubble burst in 2007.  Major spending initiatives under Obama pulled the ecomomy up from very troubled territory, but they also added greatly to the national debt. More recently, the pandemic drove huge increases in spending.  Coupled with Trump era tax cuts, this drove up total debt enourmously.

                    Here's another way to look at things.  The 2016 election was one where the electoral college winner lost the popular vote.  Using 2016 election results, iff we divide the total population of states that voted Republican by the total number of EC votes they represent, we see that each 1 million voters in those states is associated with 1.59 EV votes. That same calculation for states that voted Democratic? It's 1.57. Not exactly an overwhelming advantage for the red states.
