                        Comparing the dollar values of the national debt across 50+ years required some adjustments.  First, and most obviously, we adjusted each year's debt for inflation, to put all the values in terms of 2022 dollars. The problem with stopping there, though, is that the national debt is commonly reported on an unadjusted basis.  As an example, if the debt was $10 in Year 1, and we borrowed an additional $1 for each of the next 50 years, the debt would be reported as $60 in Year 51.  Adjusting each year's new debt for inflation and then adding the years together would show the accumulated debt as being much greater than people are used to seeing it reported.  So instead, we adjusted the debt for inflation, and then scaled each year's inflation adjusted debt to being in the range of zero to $31T (the current debt as it's commonly reported).  This effectively shows the debt each year as an inflation adjusted percentage of the total current debt.

                        Allocating each year's debt to the right president also required some adjustments.  That's because the debt accumulated in the first year of a president's term is actually associated with the budget passed during the last year of the tenure of that president's predecessor.  We allocated each year's debt according to the president in charge when the year's budget was passed, not to the president in charge when that budget became effective.

                        One other minor point.  We allocated one half of the national debt that existed before 1970 to each of the two parties.  This isn't quite accurate, of course, but the pre-1970 debt is so small compared to more recent values that it has only a miniscule impact on the results.
