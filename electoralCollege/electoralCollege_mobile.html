                            The Electoral College Doesn't Favor Red States The Way You Think It Does

                            If you think the candidate receiving the most popular votes should always win Presidential elections, then sure, the Electoral College is unfair. But if you also think that the Electoral College gives red states a big advantage, read on.  (Spoiler alert: it doesn’t.)

                    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        You probably know that because of our Electoral College system, the winner of a US Presidential election isn't always the candidate who receives the most votes. In fact, five times in US history, the candidate who won the Electoral College vote actually lost the popular vote (which is a straight count of how many people voted for each candidate). This has happened twice in the last six elections: in 2000, Bush defeated Gore but lost the popular vote 48.4% to 47.9%,  and in 2016, Trump defeated Clinton but lost the popular vote 48.2% to 46.1%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you think this is a problem, then blame the framers of the US Constitution.  They allocated EC votes to each state equal to the number of the its Congressional representatives (House and Senate combined). Each state’s House representation, of course, is based on population. But since every state, regardless of population, is represented by exactly two senators, states' total EC votes aren't proportional to their population. This means that smaller states have more EC votes than they would if total EC votes were distributed proportionally according to the states’ actual populations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, voters in states with smaller populations have a greater voice in Presidential elections than voters in more populous states. For example, let's look at the two extremes: Wyoming and California. Wyoming has about 575 thousand citizens and has three EC votes. So, each EC vote allocated to Wyoming represents about 192 thousand people. California has about 40 million people and 55 Electoral College votes, meaning each EC vote cast by California represents 727 thousand people. As a result, a vote cast in Wyoming has about 4 times as much Electoral College impact – and potential to elect a President – as a vote cast just a few hundred miles away in California:

                        <strong>The Myth of the Red State Advantage</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that in mind, it's easy to think that since red states tend to be rural and less populated, their voters must have a lot of undue influence on electoral college results in presidential elections. But the way things have played out is not that simple. Let's take a look.

                                We'll use a measure that's been called "voting power" to represent  the electoral votes per voter within a state.   Here are all the states, ranked by the voting power of each group of one million people who live there (the calculation shown here uses total population, but using only eligible voters instead doesn't have much impact on the rankings):

                        <div class="step" data-step="2">
                            <p>
                                Now let's color the bars to show the winner of the 2020 Presidential election in each state. As you can see, there's a mix of red and blue at both the top and bottom of the chart.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="step" data-step="3">
                            <p>
                                This version of the chart shows how much a voter's voting power deviates from the average in each state. Voters in states with positive bars extending to the right have more voting power than voters from a hypothetical "average state", and voters in states with negative bars extending to the left have less voting power than average.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Notice that the bars extending in the positive direction to the right of zero aren’t dominated by red states, and the negative bars aren’t dominated by blue states. In fact, among states where voters get more than average voting power, it turns out there is a near even split between red and blue states. The same is true among states where voters get less than average voting power.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Finally, let’s rearrange the chart to show deviation within each party to further illustrate how evenly split the voting power of voters in red and blue states is.  You can see that the deviation pattern is almost identical in the red and blue states.

                    Here's another way to look at things.  The 2016 election was one where the electoral college winner lost the popular vote.  Using 2016 election results, iff we divide the total population of states that voted Republican by the total number of EC votes they represent, we see that each 1 million voters in those states is associated with 1.59 EV votes. That same calculation for states that voted Democratic? It's 1.57. Not exactly an overwhelming advantage for the red states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if R's don't really have a big EC advantage, how did they win 2016 while losing the popular vote?  It's because of "wasted votes" -- meaning votes that don't help with the EC -- in big states where won by big margins by the party who loses the nationwide EC vote.  This chart shows that in 2016 the losing party --  D's -- indeed won big states by big margins.  Every vote over 50% of the popular vote is a "wasted" vote that contributes to the popular vote margin but does nothing improve the EC tally:

                        <img src="./images/2016MarginVPop.png" width="90%">
                    </center>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So in 2016, generally speaking there was a slight trend of bigger states delivering bigger margins for the Ds. Compare 2020, where the line showing the relationship between winner margin and state size goes in a slightly negative direction for the Ds.  This was driven by higher victory margins in 2020 in almost all the smaller states they won in 2016, along with small margins in the states they flipped from R to D:

                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's 2000:
