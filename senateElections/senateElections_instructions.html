                    Our charts are about evaluating election competitiveness, so we started by assigning a competitiveness score to each election.  Our metric for evaluating "competitiveness" was very simple.  We just used the difference, on a percentage point basis, between the winner and the second place finisher in each election.  So if the winner received 60% of the vote and the second place finisher received 40%, that election gets a "competitiveness score" of 20.  <strong>This means that a lower score signifies a more competitive (meaning, closer) election</strong>.

                        Each dot on a chart represents a single US Senate election in one US state.  The horizontal axis shows the year of the election.  The vertical axis shows how competitive the election was.  Note that the higher the dot is in the chart, the more competitive the election. To acheive this, we start the vertical axis at 90 (representing a 90 point margin of victory) at the bottom, and go to zero at the top (which would represent a tie, which of course never happens).  Because we're evaluating competitiveness, we thought it would be best to show more competitive elections at the top of each chart. That's why <strong>we've reversed the vertical axis from what you're probably used to seeing</strong> (the more typical chart, of course, has low numbers at the bottom and high numbers at the top).

                            There are two tools at the top of the page.  First, you can use the sliders to set the range of years that the charts will display.  You can't select a range that's smaller than four years. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Second, you can use the switches at the top of the page to toggle different lines to display on each chart.  The lines will change based on the range of years you select.  The grey lines represent the average competitiveness score (margin of victory by percentage points).  Orange lines show trends.  For both gray and orange, solid lines represent national numbers for the selected years (these will be the same on every state chart), and dotted lines represent numbers within a state.
