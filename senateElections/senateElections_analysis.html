                One hot toy this holiday season is the Level Up Gaming Chair.  It's a swivel seat with an integrated tablet computer, complete with joystick and headphones. <strong>FOR TWO YEAR OLDS.</strong>  Or, more accurately, for parents who need to "level up" their toddler. <a href="https://www.today.com/shop/hot-holiday-toys-toy-insider-t263917">Really</a>.

                In 1975, the hot holiday toy was a Pet Rock.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock">Really</a>.

            <p>
                As we were poking around with data this election season, we thought about how different our world is now from what it was then. In politics, the biggest difference might be the well documented -- and deeply felt -- rise in party partisanship.  It got us to wondering: how has this rise in partisanship impacted election results?  More specifically, does polarization affect how close elections are?  
            <p>
                We thought one way to explore this question would be to examine Senate elections since 1976 to see if we could spot any interesting changes in competitiveness.  Why did we start with 1976? Because that's the earliest year for which the Federal Election Commission <a href="fake">makes data available</a> on its website.  And because nobody could argue that the world hasn't changed much since then. Cause, you know . . . Pet Rocks.
            <p>
                Here's the short answer: <strong>The average competitiveness of Senate elections hasn't changed much over the years</strong>.  What has changed a lot, interestingly, is the <strong>variability</strong> in competitiveness from year to year. It's decreasing appreciably.  And there are some good arguments for why polarization is causing the decreased volatility.  Let's take a look.

                <p><strong>Partisanship's Impact On Competitiveness</strong></p>
                <p>
                    You might think that rising partisanship would cause Senate elections to become less competitive.  Rising polarization, by definition, means that voters become more set in their party affiliations. Shouldn't this in turn cause elections to become less competitive as red states get redder and blue states get bluer? For example, it's well known that Americans are increasingly clustering in counties that are politically homogenous: the number of Americans who live in a county that favored one party's presidential candidate by more than 20 percentage points has increased steadily <a href="https://dailyyonder.com/for-most-americans-the-local-presidential-vote-was-a-landslide/2020/12/17/">from 26% in 1976 to 58.2% in 2020</a>. Are similar dynamics at the state level causing a drop in Senate election competitiveness?
                </p>
                <p>    
                    In a word, no.  As you can see from the chart below, the average margin of victory in Senate elections actually hasn't changed much over the years.  The average victory margin across the entire period from 1976 to 2022 was 21 points. The average between 1976 and 1994 (19.66 points) was only slightly below the average for the whole period, and the average from 1998 to 2022 (22.29 points) was only slightly above the average for the whole period.

                    So what's going on?  One explanation might come from what we could call The Herschel Walker Effect.  This year's Senate election in Georgia showed us that a candidate with flaws as deeply profound as Walker's can actually come awfully close (less than three percentage points) to becoming a US Senator.  It's impossible to precisely quantify the percentage point impact that those "deeply profound flaws" had on Walker's election results.  What's not hard to see, though, is that in a world without strong party loyalty, Walker would have lost by a much larger margin (yes, the state is changing, but Georgia has clearly been very red: Republicans had, in fact, won seven of the eight Senate elections in Georgia prior to Walker's by an average of almost 10 points).  So sure, partisanship can make elections less competitive than they otherwise would be in states where one party has a clear partisan advantage and where other factors -- like candidate quality -- are equal.  But Walker shows us that partisanship can also make elections more competitive than they otherwise would be in elections where voter loyalty to a candidate's party counteracts the other candidate's advantage in suitability for office.

                <p><strong>Partisanship's Real Impact</strong></p>
                <p>  
                    You can see from just a glance at the previous chart that the interesting trend isn't about a change in average competitiveness.  It's about a change in how <strong>variable</strong> competitiveness has become.  That is, as you can see from that chart, Senate election competitiveness is much less variable than it once was.  You can see that it was a lot less stable in the first period than it was in the second, seesawing more wildly from year to year before 1998, while showing much less volitility from 1988 onward. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This next chart shows the change in competitiveness variability over time by state.  For each state, we calculated the average competitiveess (meaning the average winner margin) across all the Senate elections during the period.  We then looked at how much the winner margin in each election deviated from that average (what statisticians would call "the residual").  The line shown here shows the trend in deviation from the average for each state.  A downward slope from left to right means deviation is decreasing, while an upward slope means deviation is increasing. 
                    
                    As you can see, by an almost a 4:1 margin, far more states are showing less variability versus more variability in the competitiveness of their results.

                    So there's been a big change around how much things change: they used to change a lot more than they do now.  Why? One possibility is increased polarization, which many say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization_in_the_United_States#1990%E2%80%93present">began its big climb in the mid-90s</a>, right around when the competitiveness variability shown in these results started decreasing.  Because polarization makes voters more set in their party affiliations, it would make sense that it would cause swings in competitiveness within a state to become less dramatic.  The law of large numbers (365 and 446 elections in the pre and post 1998 periods, respectively) gets us to roughly the same average competitiveness across both periods, but less voter openness to party switching means less variability in competitiveness since the 90s. Stated another way, <strong>it's not that partisanship is making  red states redder and blue states bluer.  It's that every state is becoming more reliably as red or as blue as it's generally been</strong>.

                    You can look at the state-by-state analysis in our companion piece "<a href="senateElections.html">How Competitive Are Senate Elections in Your State?</a>" to see this in action.  Turn on the "Winner Margin: State" line to show the average competitiveness in each state.  Then take a look at the pattern of dots, each one representing a single election, in the states. You'll see that most often, the dots cluster closer to the line to the right of the chart, meaning in years closer to today. By way of example,  Hawaii and Idaho (see chart) are about as far apart as states can get politically (even though they're right next to each other in alphabetical state order -- it must be so awkward when they sit at their desks every morning in homeroom).  You can see that even within individual states with similar average competitiveness, the variability in competitiveness decreases over time, as the elections get closer to the mean (represented by the horizontal line).  Go to the <a href="senateElections.html">companion piece</a> and check out the other states to see a remarkably similar pattern across many (although of course not all) states.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This change in variability has happened even though there's an almost dead even split between states where competitiveness is increasing since 1976 (26) and states where competition is decreasing (24) (turn on the "Trend: State" line in the <a href="senateElections.html">companion piece</a> to see that). Bottom line: there's a strong argument to be made that while increasing polarization hasn't made Senate elections less competitive, it has made them less volatile.

                <p>
                    Quick: what state has had the tightest Senate elections since 1976?  If your mind is cycling through the infamous swing states to find an answer, don't bother.  It's actually (drum roll) . . . North Carolina.  The least competitive state is less surprising: Hawaii.  Things don't move much even if you only look at elections since 2000: North Carolina still takes the top spot, with  Wyoming becoming least competitive and Hawaii second.
