                It's not partisanship, it's just math: Republicans are more responsible for the current national debt than Democrats.  How much more depends on how you look at things.

                        When Martin Van Buren became President in 1837, the US had no debt.  That's because his predecessor, Andrew Jackson, inherited a bill of $58 million, declared it a "national curse", and paid it off.  But, hey, stuff happens, and Van Buren found himself looking at the need to do something about the Panic of 1837.  So he started borrowing.  And we haven't been debt free since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also haven't been free from finger pointing over who's responsible.  Because to say we're not debt-free is, ahem, something of an understatement. Our debt has increased (ballooned? exploded? metastasized?) from the $1.5 million Van Burren borrowed to over $30 trillion today.  It's become a familiar game: Republicans blame "tax and spend" Democrats for running up deficits, while Democrats look at Republicans' spending history and call them hypocrites.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As most of us know, the truth is that both sides have increased the debt considerably.  That's because no matter who's in charge, events of the day drive the need, or at least the urge, to spend.  But the bottom line is that on an inflation adjusted basis, Republican administrations bear more responsibility for the debt than Democrats.  The summary is that <strong>in total inflation adjusted dollars, the Republican share of the debt is almost double the Democrats' share, but on an average per year basis, the difference between the parties is much smaller.</strong> Let's take a look.

                                Here is the running total of the debt as it stood for each year from 1970 to 2022, adjusted for inflation to reflect 2022 dollar values.  The following charts will allocate this debt to the political party in power when the debt was incurred (if you're interested, here are <a href="fake">more details</a> about the methodology used for our analysis).

                                The green section of the bars represents new debt accumulated each year.  Don't be fooled by what look like small numbers during the 70s.  Nixon increased the debt by 34%, while the four presidents who preceded him increased it by an average of only 8% each.

                                The Reagan - Bush era was the beginning of the modern spike in debt, as annual budget deficits increased considerably.  Reagan came into office promising smaller government in the form of both reduced taxes and reduced spending.  Reducing taxes turned out to be a lot easier than taking away government benefits.  So taxes went down, but expenditures didn't.  As anyone who balances a checkbook at their kitchen table can tell you, making less and spending more is not the path to paying down debt.  The national debt increased at an unprecedented rate.

                                The bars associated with the Clinton years stand out by staying down.  Fiscally, Clinton was Reagan's opposite: Clinton raised taxes, particularly on the wealthy, and cut spending.  It also didn't hurt that he presided over a period of great economic growth (including the dot-com boom).  The result was balanced budgets -- we haven't seen them since.

                                When ranked by the percentage increase to national debt during their administration, George W. Bush ranks near the top of all Presidents.  His administration paid for the second (much larger) Iraq War and the start of the War in Afghanistan, and faced the 2001 recession and the beginning of the financial crisis.

                                Obama took office during the early stages of the Great Recession, which had started under Bush II when the housing bubble burst in 2007.  Major spending initiatives under Obama pulled the ecomomy up from very troubled territory, but they also added greatly to the national debt. More recently, the pandemic drove huge increases in spending.  Coupled with Trump era tax cuts, this drove up total debt enormously.

                                And now we come to our point.  It doesn't require a chart reading genius to see that on an inflation adjusted basis, since 1970 the Republicans are responsible for nearly twice as much debt as the Democrats.  The problem with this view of things is that Republicans also held power for a longer period of time.  In fact, Republicans were responsible for the debt for 31 of the 53 years from 1970 to 2022, versus 22 years for the Democrats.

                        So some would argue that a better way to allocate responsibility between the parties is to look at the average debt that accumulated per year when each party was in charge.  The difference between the two parties, of course, shrinks considerably with this view.  On a per year, inflation adjusted basis, on average the Republican annual debt increase was only 7% greater than the Democratic annual debt increase ($619B per year vs. $533B per year).  
                    </p>

                    <div id="perYearChart">

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        What's the final take away?  As most of us know, the Republican talking point about the Democrats' reckless spending is disingenuous, at least in a comparative sense.  At the same time, Democrats who point to Reagan's budget deficits, or, more recently, Trump's tax cut / spending spree, etc., can't really claim a moral spending high ground,  with only a 7% difference in average annual debt accumulation responsibility.
