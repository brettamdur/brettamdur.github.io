                        Did Republicans actually vote pro-choice? Or maybe it was a big Dem turnout?  What about those mysterious "swing voters"?  A look at which voting groups drove the huge abortion rights victory in Kansas.

            <p>
                Pro-choice advocates got an enormous win on August 2 when Kansas voters defeated a proposed constitutional amendment that would have opened the door to abortion bans in their state.  The vote was shockingly lopsided. In deeply red Kansas, where Republicans outnumber Democrats by a margin of almost 2:1, voters defeated the proposal 59% to 41%.
            </p>
            <p>

                The surprise result begs the question: what actually happened here?  Did Republicans abandon their party's orthodoxy and vote pro-choice?  Did Democrats totally rock their get-out-the-vote effort? Or was it all about turning out Independent voters?  Let's take a look.

                <p><strong>Trump Results Vs. Abortion Amendment Results</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We'll start by comparing Trump's performance in the 2020 election to the abortion amendment results in 2022.  A county by county analysis shows us just how profound the shellacking (great word -- thanks, Obama!) was.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this chart, the blue bars show Trump's 2020 margin of victory, by number of percentage points, in each Kansas county.  The orange bars show the margin of victory for Yes votes (the anti-abortion position) in the referendum.  So negative blue bars show counties where Biden won, and negative orange bars show counties where No votes won.  I've given you the detail for Wallace County, where Trump won most decisively, as an example:

                    One thing jumps out right away: the Yes votes underperformed Trump in every single county in Kansas.  That's right: even in the most conservative Kansas counties, anti-abortion sentiment is not nearly as strong as pro-Trump sentiment.  The whopping differences between the Trump vote margin and the Yes vote margin in Greenwood and Elk Counties are nothing short of astounding.  Yes, Greenwood and Elk are both small counties (about 2,000 and 1,000 votes cast, respectively, in the referendum), but still:

                <p><strong>Partisanship's Real Impact</strong></p>
                <p>  
                    You can see from just a glance at the previous chart that the interesting trend isn't about a change in average competitiveness.  It's about a change in how <strong>variable</strong> competitiveness has become.  That is, as you can see from that chart, Senate election competitiveness is much less variable than it once was.  You can see that it was a lot less stable in the first period than it was in the second, seesawing more wildly from year to year before 1998, while showing much less volitility from 1988 onward. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This next chart shows the change in competitiveness variability over time, by state.  For each state, we calculated the average competitiveess (meaning the average winner margin) across all the Senate elections during the period.  We then looked at how much the winner margin in each election deviated from that average (what statisticians would call "the residual").  The line shown here shows the trend in deviation (which you can think of as "variability" or "volitility") in election results from the average for each state.  A downward slope from left to right means volitility is decreasing, while an upward slope means volitility is increasing. 
                </pp>
                <p>
                    
                    As you can see, by an almost a 4:1 margin, far more states are showing a trend over time toward less volitility versus more volitility in the competitiveness of their results.

                    So there's been a big change around how much things change: they used to change a lot more than they do now.  Why? One possibility is increased polarization, which many say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization_in_the_United_States#1990%E2%80%93present">began its big climb in the mid-90s</a>, right around when the competitiveness variability shown in these results started decreasing.  Because polarization makes voters more set in their party affiliations, it would make sense that it would cause swings in competitiveness within a state to become less dramatic.  The law of large numbers (365 and 446 elections in the pre and post 1998 periods, respectively) gets us to roughly the same average competitiveness across both periods, but less voter openness to party switching means less variability in competitiveness since the 90s. Stated another way, <strong>it's not that partisanship is making  red states redder and blue states bluer.  It's that every state is becoming more reliably as red or as blue as it's generally been</strong>.

                    You can look at the state-by-state analysis in our companion piece "<a href="senateElections.html">How Competitive Are Senate Elections in Your State?</a>" to see this in action.  Turn on the "Winner Margin: State" line to show the average competitiveness in each state.  Then take a look at the pattern of dots, each one representing a single election, in the states. You'll see that most often, the dots cluster closer to the line to the right of the chart, meaning in years closer to today. By way of example,  Hawaii and Idaho (see chart) are about as far apart as states can get politically (even though they're right next to each other in alphabetical state order -- it must be so awkward when they sit at their desks every morning in homeroom).  You can see that even within individual states with similar average competitiveness, the variability in competitiveness decreases over time, as the elections get closer to the mean (represented by the horizontal line).  Go to the <a href="senateElections.html">companion piece</a> and check out the other states to see a remarkably similar pattern across many (although of course not all) states.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This change in variability has happened even though there's an almost dead even split between states where competitiveness is increasing since 1976 (26) and states where competition is decreasing (24) (turn on the "Trend: State" line in the <a href="senateElections.html">companion piece</a> to see that). Bottom line: there's a strong argument to be made that while increasing polarization hasn't made Senate elections less competitive, it has made them less volatile.

                <p><strong>What About Incumbents?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    "But wait!" you say, being the savvy political observer that you are. "What about the incumbency advantage? I happen to know that in the 446 Senate elections since 1982 where an incumbent was running, the incubment has won a whopping 91 percent of the time!  So if incumbency is so determinative, the winner's margin must be really high in elections where an incumbent runs compared to elections where an incumbent doesn't run.  So things must look different if we account for incumbency, right?"

                <p>
                    Incumbancy doesn't affect the analysis as much as you might expect. The chart below compares the average winner margin for elections where an incumbent ran and where an incumbent didn't run (it also excludes the few elections where the winner ran unopposed). Since 1982 there's only about a six point difference between the average margin in elections with incumbents (23.38 point margin) compared to elections without them (17.14 point margin).  Six points certainly isn't nothing, but it's less than a third of the average margin in all Senate elections since 1982. As you can see from the chart, there's actully been a really large (greater than 10 points, let's say) difference between incumbent and non-incumbent elections in only five of the 21 Senate election years since 1982.

                    The next chart uses the same data as the previous one but displays it in a different way.  Here, for each year, we're looking at the difference between the average margin in elections with incumbents and elections without incumbents. In other words, for each year we're showing the gap between the two lines shown in the previous chart.  You can see that since 2008, the incumbency advantage has been less dramatic, at least as compared to the period between 1992 and 2006.  In fact, in half of the election years after 2006, the average margin in elections without an incumbent was bigger than the average margin in elections with an incumbent (we'll leave for another day an assessment of what was going on between 1982 and 1990, when four out of five election years saw bigger margins in elections where incumbents didn't run).

                    Why doesn't incumbency have more of an impact on winner margin, and why does the incumbency advantage appear to be shrinking somewhat?  Once again, it may just be that party loyalty trumps everything these days.  Incumbents win now with the same frequency that they always did. Increasingly, though, incumbents winning general elections might be more linked to the incumbent being affiliated with the party that rules their state than it is with incumbency itself. In other words, the fact that for the most part margins in non-incumbent elections are becoming more similar to the margins in incumbent elections might suggest that the margins in all elections are driven more by the popularity of the parties in each state than by any incumbency advantage.  
                </p> 
                <p>
                    More support for this line of thinking comes from the connection between the results of Senate and Presidential elections within a state. In the just completed 2022 Senate elections, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/12/08/in-2022-midterms-nearly-all-senate-election-results-again-matched-states-presidential-votes/">only one of the 35 Senate elections resulted in a winner from a different party than the winner of the Presidential election in that state</a> (Republican Ron Johnson won in Wisconsin, where President Biden won in 2020).  That connection has been stronger than ever over the last 10 years -- roughly the same period during which the margin difference in incumbent and non-incumbent races has compressed.

                <p>
                    Quick: what state has had the tightest Senate elections since 1976?  If your mind is cycling through the infamous swing states to find an answer, don't bother.  It's actually (drum roll) . . . North Carolina.  The least competitive state is less surprising: Hawaii.  Things don't move much even if you only look at elections since 2000: North Carolina still takes the top spot, with  Wyoming becoming least competitive and Hawaii second.
