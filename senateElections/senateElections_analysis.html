                        The rise in political partisanship hasn't made Senate elections less competitive. But it might be making them less volatile.

                    One hot toy this holiday season is the Level Up Gaming Chair.  It's a swivel seat with an integrated tablet computer, complete with joystick and headphones. <strong>FOR TWO YEAR OLDS.</strong>  Or, more accurately, for parents who need to "level up" their toddler. <a href="https://www.today.com/shop/hot-holiday-toys-toy-insider-t263917">Really</a>.

                    In 1975, the hot holiday toy was a Pet Rock.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock">Really</a>.

                    As we were poking around with data this election season, we thought about how different our world is now from what it was then.  It got us to wondering: have political elections, like holiday toy crazes, become unrecognizable from what they were in the mid 70s?  We thought one way to help explore this question would be to examine Senate elections since 1976 to see if we could spot any interesting changes in how competitive they are.  Why did we start with 1976? Because that's the earliest year for which the Federal Election Commission <a href="fake">makes data available</a> on its website.  And because nobody could argue that the world hasn't changed much since then. Cause, you know . . . Pet Rocks.

                    We were especially interested in the question of whether the dramatic increase in political polarization over the years has caused a decrease in the competitiveness of Senate elections. For example, it's well known that Americans are increasingly clustering in counties that are politically homogenous: the number of Americans who live in a county that favored one party's presidential candidate by more than 20 percentage points has increased steadily <a href="https://dailyyonder.com/for-most-americans-the-local-presidential-vote-was-a-landslide/2020/12/17/">from 26% in 1976 to 58.2% in 2020.</a> Do these and other similar dynamics that drive increased polarization also reduce the competitiveness of statewide Senate elections?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer, generally, is no.  Collectively, Senate elections seem resiliant to the polarization forces that one might think would push races to become less competitive.

                    We dig into the data below, and we point out some things we discovered along the way that we thought were interesting.  We also encourage you to check out "<a href="senateElections.html">How Competitive Are Senate Elections in Your State?</a>", which is a companion page to this piece where you can use interactive tools to explore the data on a state-by-state basis.

                        Let's start with the big picture. Our first chart shows that the average margin of victory in Senate elections isn't really trending in any particular direction.  The average victory margin across the entire period from 1976 to 2022 was 21 points. The average between 1976 and 1994 (19.66 points) was only slightly below the average for the whole period, and the average from 1998 to 2022 (22.29 points) was only slightly above the average for the whole period.  
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        The interesting trend that jumps out from this chart isn't around a change in average competitiveness, but rather a change in how variable competitiveness has become.  As you can see, Senate election competitiveness was a lot less stable in the first period than it was in the second, seesawing more wildly from year to year before 1998, while showing much less volitility from 1988 onward. Why the change?  One possibility is increased polarization, which many say <a href="fake">began its big climb in the mid-90s</a>.  Because polarization, by definition, makes voters more set in their party affiliations, it would make sense that it would cause swings in competitiveness within a state to become less dramatic.  The law of large numbers (365 and 446 elections in the pre and post 1998 periods, respectively) gets us to roughly the same average competitiveness across both periods, but less voter openness to party switching means less variability in competitiveness since the 90s.

                         A look at the state-by-state analysis in our companion piece "<a href="senateElections.html">How Competitive Are Senate Elections in Your State?</a>" provides some good corraboration for this theory.  Hawaii and Idaho (see chart) are about as far apart as states can get politically (even though they're right next to each other in alphabetical state order -- it must be so awkward when they sit at their desks every morning in homeroom).  You can see that even within individual states with similar average competitiveness, the variability in competitiveness decreases over time, as the elections get closer to the mean (represented by the horizontal line).  Go to the <a href="senateElections.html">companion piece</a> and check out the other states to see a remarkably similar pattern across many (although of course not all) states.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         We'll save you some time: 36 states show decreasing variabilty in competitiveness over time, while only 14 states show increasing variability.  That's true even though there's an almost even split between states where competition is increasing since 1976 (26) and states where competition is decreaing (24). Bottom line: there's a strong argument to be made that while increasing polarization hasn't made Senate elections less competitive, it has made them less volatile.

                         Here's another interesting point that popped out.  The chart below shows the  line we saw above for average winner margin by year, along with a second line (the lighter one) that shows the same info but with elections involving incumbents removed, along with a few elections where the winner ran unopposed.  As you can see, the margins in non-incumbent elections are remarkably similar to the margins in all elections.  In fact, there's a large average margin difference in only five of the 21 Senate election years since 1982. 
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                         This feels counterintuitive.  We know that incumbency is a huge advantage: in the ___ elections since 1976 where an incumbent ran, the incumbent won ___% of the time.  If incumbency is so important, why don't incumbents generate much bigger victory margins than victorious non-incumbents?  The answer probably points to a phenomenon that's similar to the polarization point we just made.  Here, it may be that party loyalty trumps all.  Yes, incumbents are likely to win, but not because they generate landslides. Since incumbency generally doesn't generate big decreases in competitiveness, incumbents winning general elections has a lot more to do with the incumbent being affiliated with the party that's more popular in their state than it does with incumbency itself. In other words, the fact that the margins in non-incumbent elections are similar to the margins in all elections suggests that the margins in all elections are driven more by the popularity of the parties in each state than by any incumbency advantage.  (BUT NOTE: what's going on from 2000 to 2006 and again in 2012? Stay tuned for more analysis in a later piece.)
