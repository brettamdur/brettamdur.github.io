                    One hot toy this holiday season is the Level Up Gaming Chair.  It's a swivel seat with an integrated tablet computer, complete with joystick and headphones. <strong>FOR TWO YEAR OLDS.</strong>  Or, more accurately, for parents who are presumably concerned that they need to "level up" their toddler. <a href="https://www.today.com/shop/hot-holiday-toys-toy-insider-t263917">Really</a>.

                    In 1975, the hot holiday toy was a Pet Rock.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock">Really</a>.

                    We thought about how different our world is now from what it was then as we were poking around with data this election season.  It got us to wondering.  Have political elections, like holiday toy crazes, become unrecognizable from what they were in the mid 70s?  We thought one way to help explore this question would be to examine Senate elections since 1976 to see if we could spot any interesting changes in how competitive they are.  Why did we start with 1976? Because that's the earliest year for which the Federal Election Commission <a href="fake">makes data available</a> on its website.  And because nobody could argue that the world hasn't changed much since then. Cause, you know . . . Pet Rocks.

                    We were especially interested in the question of whether the dramatic increase in polarization over the years is correlated with a decrease in the competitiveness of Senate elections. It's well known that, increasingly, Americans are clustering in counties that are more and more politically homogenous: the number of Americans who live in a county that favored one party's presidential candidate by more than 20 percentage points has increased steadily <a href="https://dailyyonder.com/for-most-americans-the-local-presidential-vote-was-a-landslide/2020/12/17/">from 26% in 1976 to 58.2% in 2020.</a> Do these and other similar dynamics that drive increased polarization also reduce the competitiveness of statewide Senate elections?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer, generally, is no.  Collectively, Senate elections seem resiliant to the polarization forces that one might think would push races to become less competitive.

                    We dig into the data below, and we point out some things we discovered along the way that we thought were interesting.  We also encourage you to check out "<a href="senateElections.html">How Competitive Are Senate Elections in Your State?</a>", which is a companion page to this piece where you can use interactive tools to explore the data on a state-by-state basis.
