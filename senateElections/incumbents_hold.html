        <p><strong>What About Incumbents?</strong></p>
        <p>    
            You might be able to make a decent argument that the the benefits of incumbency are declining as the importance of party loyalty increases.  
        </p>
        <p>
            First, some background. As you probably know, incubency is a huge advantage in elections.  In the 446 Senate elections since 1982 where an incumbent was running, the incubment has won a whopping 91 percent of the time.  So if incumbency is so determinative, the winner's margin must be really high in elections where an incumbent runs compared to elections where an incumbent doesn't run.  Right?  
        </p>
        <p>
            Actually, not so much.  The chart below compares the average winner margin for elections where an incumbent ran and where an incumbent didn't run (it also excludes the few elections where the winner ran unopposed). Since 1982 there's only about a six point difference between the average margin in elections with incumbents (23.38 point margin) compared to elections without them (17.14 point margin).  Six points certainly isn't nothing, but it's less than a third of the average margin in all Senate elections since 1982. As you can see from the chart, there's actully been a really large (greater than 10 points, let's say) difference between incumbent and non-incumbent elections in only five of the 21 Senate election years since 1982.

            The next chart uses the same data as the previous one but displays it in a different way.  Here, for each year, we're looking at the difference between the average margin in elections with incumbents and elections without incumbents. In other words, for each year we're showing the gap between the two lines shown in the previous chart.  Returning to our original point about the possibly diminishing importance of incumbency, you can see that since 2008, the incumbency advantage has been less dramatic, at least as compared to the period between 1992 and 2006.  In fact, in half of the election years after 2006, the average margin in elections without an incumbent was bigger than the average margin in elections with an incumbent (we'll leave for another day an assessment of what was going on between 1982 and 1990, when four out of five election years saw bigger margins in elections where incumbents didn't run).

            So if the incumbency advantage is diminishing, why?  It may just be that party loyalty trumps everything these days.  Incumbents are no less likely to win now than they always were. Increasingly, though, incumbents winning general elections might be more linked to the incumbent being affiliated with the party that rules their state than it is with incumbency itself. In other words, the fact that for the most part margins in non-incumbent elections are becoming more similar to the margins in incumbent elections suggests that the margins in all elections are driven more by the popularity of the parties in each state than by any incumbency advantage.

            More support for this line of thinking comes from the connection between the results of Senate and Presidential elections within a state. In the just completed 2022 Senate elections, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/12/08/in-2022-midterms-nearly-all-senate-election-results-again-matched-states-presidential-votes/">only one of the 35 Senate elections resulted in a winner from a different party than the winner of the Presidential election in that state</a> (Republican Ron Johnson won in Wisconsin, where President Biden won in 2020).  That connection has been stronger than ever over the last 10 years -- roughly the same period during which the margin difference in incumbent and non-incumbent races has compressed.
