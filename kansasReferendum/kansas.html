                Pro-choice advocates got an enormous win on August 2 when Kansas voters defeated a proposed constitutional amendment that would have opened the door to abortion bans in their state.  The vote was shockingly lopsided. In deeply red Kansas, where Republicans outnumber Democrats by a margin of almost 2:1, voters defeated the proposal 59% to 41%.
            </p>
            <p>

                The surprise result begs the question: what actually happened here?  Did Republicans abandon their party's orthodoxy and vote pro-choice?  Did Democrats totally rock their get-out-the-vote effort? Or was it all about turning out Independent voters?

                This is data journalism, not a mystery novel, so I guess all that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)">inverted pyramid stuff</a> means we have start by spoiling the surprise.  So here you go: significantly, the numbers show that, more than anything elese, Republicans "flipping" to the pro-choice side drove the big pro-choice win.  Let's dive in.

                <p><strong>Trump Results Vs. Abortion Amendment Results</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We should start with a look at how profound the shellacking was (great word -- thanks, Obama!).  One way to do that is to compare Trump's performance in the 2020 election to the abortion amendment results in 2022.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this chart, the blue bars show Trump's 2020 margin of victory, by number of percentage points, in each Kansas county.  The orange bars show the margin of victory for Yes votes (the anti-abortion position) in the referendum.  So negative blue bars show counties where Biden won, and negative orange bars show counties where No votes won.  I've given you the detail for Wallace County, where Trump won most decisively, as an example:

                    One thing jumps out right away: the Yes votes underperformed Trump in every single county in Kansas.  That's right: even in the most conservative Kansas counties, anti-abortion sentiment is not nearly as strong as pro-Trump sentiment.  The whopping differences between the Trump vote margin and the Yes vote margin in Greenwood and Elk Counties are nothing short of astounding.  Yes, Greenwood and Elk are both small counties (about 2,000 and 1,000 votes cast, respectively, in the referendum), but still:

                    How about this: there were 19 counties that Trump won handily (by between 10 and 61 percentage points) where anti-abortion proponents either tied or flat out lost:

                    Here's another way of looking at the Trump support versus anti-abortion support.  On the left we see the Trump margin of victory in each county, with greater margins represented by darker colors.  On the right we see the same map for the Yes margin of victory.  Not entirely surprising given the charts above, but the Trump margin of victory map is considerably darker.

                    Was the pro-choice vote heavily concentrated in big counties?  That depends on how you look at things. On one hand, it certainly wasn't the case that one or two counties provided enough votes to win the election.  That's because there were 922,000 people who voted in the Yes/No referendum, so 461,000 votes were required to win.  The chart below shows the results from the 30 biggest counties in Kansas.  The bars display a running total of the number of votes from those counties.  Orange shows No votes, blue shows Yes votes.  As you can see, you would have to count No votes from the biggest 20 counties (out of 105 total counties in Kansas) before the Nos would have enough votes to win:

                    On the other hand, if you completely threw out the votes from the four biggest counties in the state, the anti-abortion side would have won (and it was a virtual tie after throwing out just three counties):

                    So together, these two points show that the large counties were necessary, but not sufficient, for the abortion rights win.

                    <strong>Trump Flippers vs. Turnout Efforts vs. Independents</strong>
                </p>
                <p>

                    Ok, we get it.  The anti-abortion supporters got shellacked (a word so nice, I had to use it twice).  But why?  What unexpected voting behavior drove the result?  Here are the three big possibilities:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maybe a lot of Trump voters rejected conservative orthodoxy and voted pro-choice.  </li>
                        <li>Maybe this was about good old fashioned shoe leather politics, and Kansas Dems just did a dramatically better job getting out the vote versus Republicans.</li>
                        <li>Or maybe this had less to do with D and Rs and more to do with Is.  Did Independents make all the difference?</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we get to the answers, some background.  The referendum vote took place at the same time as the 2022 Kansas primary election.  Kansas primaries are closed, meaning voters can only vote in their party's primary (as opposed to "open" primaries, where voters can vote for candidates from either party and the top total vote getters, regardless of party, move on).  Kansas does not release party affiliation associated with votes received on ballot measures like the proposed constitutional amendment on abortion.   But if you look at the data they do make available, and squint a little, answers start to emerge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So let's start with the turnout question. To be sure, total turnout this year far exceeded turnout for any other recent Kansas primary (although you could actually argue that the big primary election turnout numbers this time were nothing more than a continuation of the trend that started in 2016):
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pointimage">
                <a href="./chart7.png"><img class="varimage" src="./chart7.png"></a>

        <div class="pointcontainer">
            <div id="pointtext">
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Kansas doesn't publish a breakdown of turnout by party (at least not on their website).  They obviously do, however, publish the results of primary elections.  Since Kansas primaries are closed, the total number of votes received in each party's elections are a pretty good proxy for turnout by party (yes, the count of votes cast in a party's primary election can be different depending on the specific race -- state governor, US representative, Senate, etc., but the total votes cast in the different races are usually pretty close).  So here is primary turnout by party, using total votes received in one election for each party per year as a proxy for turnout:  
                </p>    
            </div>
            <div class="pointimage">
                <a href="./chart8.png"><img class="varimage" src="./chart8.png"></a>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="pointcontainer">
            <div id="pointtext">
                <p>
                    As you can see, Dem turnout vs. Republicans was a little better this year, but not nearly enough to explain the huge abortion rights win in the referendum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So turnout wasn't the driver of the referendum results in Kansas.  What about the Independents who aren't shown in the previous chart?  Well they definitely came out in force.  Using our same methodology for determining turnout (that is, using total votes received in the party's primary elections as a proxy for turnout), we see that 737,000 people voted in the D and R primaries in 2022, and 923,000 people voted in the referendum.  So there must have been 186,000 Independents who voted in the referendum (923k - 737k).  That's more than 20% of all referendum votes, which is definitely a lot considering that Independents couldn't vote in the party races (remember, closed primary).  In other words, the referendum was the only reason for Independents to show up at the polls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But here's the thing: even if every single one of those Independents voted No on the amendment, that still wouldn't nearly account for the size of the abortion rights win.  As you can see, even if every single Democrat along with every single Independent voted No on the referendum, the No vote would still be 76,000 votes short of the number of No votes actually received:  
                </p>    
            </div>
            <div class="pointimage">
                <a href="./chart9.png"><img class="varimage" src="./chart9.png"></a>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="pointcontainer">
            <div id="pointtext">
                <p>
                    There's only one explanation left, and its a big one.  To get to the number of No votes cast, AT LEAST 76,000 Republicans must have voted No on the referendum.  That means that AT LEAST 17% of the 455,000 Republicans who voted in the 2022 Republican primaries would have to have voted in favor of abortion rights on the referendum.  Again, that's an AT LEAST number because certainly some Dems and some Independents voted Yes, which only increases the number of Republicans who must have voted No.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it took us a little while to get here, but the bottom line is big.  It wasn't shocking Democratic turnout.  It wasn't just the swarm of Independents.  It took a lot of Republicans -- a LOT -- voting for abortion rights to get to the numbers we saw in the Kansas referendum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Wow.  So Republicans really did "flip".  What does this say about other elections?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Does the Kansas abortion vote spell trouble for Republicans generally?  That probably depends on the intensity of voter opinion on abortion, which is something the referendum didn't really measure.  Certainly, some of the many Kansas conservatives who supported the abortion rights side fall into the category of people who would say "If you ask me whether our constitution should allow an abortion ban, I'll vote no, but I don't feel so strongly about it that it would keep me from voting Republican."
